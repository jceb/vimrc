DESCRIPTION					    *visualrepeat-description*

This plugin defines repetition of Vim built-in normal mode commands via |.|
for visual mode. Additionally, it offers functions like the popular repeat.vim
plugin that allow mappings to be repeated in visual mode, too. 

VISUAL MODE REPETITION							    * 

This extends the built-in normal mode repeat |.| to visual mode. 

VISUAL MODE MAPPING REPETITION						    * 

Like with repeat.vim for normal mode, visual mode mappings can register a
<Plug> mapping to be used for visual mode repetition. 

Likewise, normal mode mappings can (in addition to the repeat.vim registration
of a normal mode mapping) register a visual mode mapping with visualrepeat.vim
that will be repeated in visual mode. 

Operator-pending mappings end with |g@| and repeat naturally; i.e. Vim
re-applies the 'opfunc' on the equivalent text (but at the current cursor
position). But without a call to repeat#set(), it is impossible to repeat this
operator-pending mapping to the current visual selection. Plugins cannot call
repeat#set() in their operator-pending mapping, because then Vim's built-in
repeat would be circumvented, the full mapping ending with g@ would be
re-executed, and the repetition would then wait for the {motion}, what is not
wanted. 
Therefore, this plugin offers a separate visualrepeat#set() function that can
be invoked for operator-pending mappings. It can also be invoked for
normal-mode mappings that have already called repeat#set(), and may override
that mapping with a special repeat mapping for visual mode repeats. Together
with the remapped {Visual}. command, this allows repetition - similar to what
the built-in Vim commands do - across normal, operator-pending and visual
mode.  

SOURCE									     *

- Based on vimtip #1142, Repeat last command and put cursor at start of change
    http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Repeat_last_command_and_put_cursor_at_start_of_change
- The client interface and implementation has been based on repeat.vim
  (vimscript #2136) by Tim Pope. 

RELATED WORKS								     *

- repeat.vim (vimscript #2136) has been the basis for this plugin and should
  be used in conjunction with visualrepeat.vim. (Otherwise, you'd have visual
  mode repeat, but no repeat in normal mode.) 

==============================================================================
USAGE							  *visualrepeat-usage*
									 *v_.*
{Visual}.		Repeat last change in all visually selected lines. 
			- characterwise: Start from cursor position. 
			- linewise: Each line separately, starting from first column. 
			- blockwise: Not supported. 

			Note: If the last normal mode command included a
			{motion} (e.g. g~e), the repetition will also move
			exactly over this {motion}, NOT the visual selection!
			It is thus best to repeat commands that work on the
			entire line (e.g. g~$). 

==============================================================================
INSTALLATION					   *visualrepeat-installation*

This script is packaged as a |vimball|. If you have the "gunzip" decompressor
in your PATH, simply edit the *.vba.gz package in Vim; otherwise, decompress
the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by sourcing the
vimball or via the |:UseVimball| command. >
    vim visualrepeat.vba.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the |:RmVimball| command. 

DEPENDENCIES					   *visualrepeat-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.0 or higher. 
- repeat.vim (vimscript #2136) plugin (highly recommended). 

==============================================================================
INTEGRATION					    *visualrepeat-integration*

This plugin is meant to be used together with repeat.vim.
