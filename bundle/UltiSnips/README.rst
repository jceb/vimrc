UltiSnips
=========

This is the official repository for UltiSnips on GitHub. It is held in sync
with the official bzr repository over at Launchpad [1] and is meant as a
convenience for contributors. Send Pull request to this repository, not
the automatic clone from vim-scripts.

Note that we do not use the Issue tracker here one GitHub because the one on
Launchpad is superior and already has a significant history. Please report
`issues over there`_.
