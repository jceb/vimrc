My personal vim configuration which aims for high convenience and ease of use
=============================================================================

USAGE
-----

The first thing you should do is install quilt and apply all the
patches. This is useful because a lot of the installed plugins didn't
fit my needs or have little bugs that disrupt my work.
Once you are done with this you might want to add a .vim/personal.vim
file which contains additional settings.

Every plugin that's used for this configuration has been registered in
the file .vim/GetLatest/GetLatestVimScripts.dat additionally all changes
I did to the plugins are tracked by quilt in the patches directory.

To get an idea of what plugins are available and how to use them run
:h config

That's basically it.

If you have questions, comments, patches ... please send it to
github@DELETE-ME-e-jc.de
