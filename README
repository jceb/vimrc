My bubbling vim configuration which I use on a daily basis
==========================================================

USAGE
-----

The first thing you should do is install quilt and apply all the
patches. Once you are done with this you might want to add a
.vim/personal.vim file which contains additional settings.

Every plugin that's used for this configuration has been registered in
the GetLatestVimScripts.dat additionally all changes I did to the
plugins are tracked by quilt in the patches directory.

That's basically it.

If you have comments, patches ... please send them to
github@DELETE-ME-e-jc.de
