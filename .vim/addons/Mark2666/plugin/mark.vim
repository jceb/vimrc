" Dependencies:
"  - Requires Vim 7.1 with "matchadd()", or Vim 7.2 or higher. 
"  - mark.vim autoload script. 
" 
" Version:     2.3.2
" Changes:
" 17-Nov-2009, Ingo Karkat
"   - Replaced the (overly) generic mark#GetVisualSelectionEscaped() with
"     mark#GetVisualSelectionAsRegexp() and
"     mark#GetVisualSelectionAsLiteralPattern(). 
"
" 04-Jul-2009, Ingo Karkat
" - A [count] before any mapping either caused "No range allowed" error or just
"   repeated the :call [count] times, resulting in the current search pattern
"   echoed [count] times and a hit-enter prompt. Now suppressing [count] via
"   <C-u> and handling it inside the implementation. 
" - Now passing isBackward (0/1) instead of optional 'b' flag into functions. 
"   Also passing empty regexp to mark#MarkRegex() to avoid any optional
"   arguments. 
"
" 02-Jul-2009, Ingo Karkat
" - Split off functions into autoload script. 
" - Removed g:force_reload_mark. 
" - Initialization of global variables and autocommands is now done lazily on
"   the first use, not during loading of the plugin. This reduces Vim startup
"   time and footprint as long as the functionality isn't yet used. 
"
" 6-Jun-2009, Ingo Karkat
"  1. Somehow s:WrapMessage() needs a redraw before the :echo to avoid that a
"     later Vim redraw clears the wrap message. This happened when there's no
"     statusline and thus :echo'ing into the ruler. 
"  2. Removed line-continuations and ':set cpo=...'. Upper-cased <SID> and <CR>. 
"  3. Added default highlighting for the special search type. 
"
" 2-Jun-2009, Ingo Karkat
"  1. Replaced highlighting via :syntax with matchadd() / matchdelete(). This
"     requires Vim 7.2 / 7.1 with patches. This method is faster, there are no
"     more clashes with syntax highlighting (:match always has preference), and
"     the background highlighting does not disappear under 'cursorline'. 
"  2. Factored :windo application out into s:MarkScope(). 
"  3. Using winrestcmd() to fix effects of :windo: By entering a window, its
"     height is potentially increased from 0 to 1. 
"  4. Handling multiple tabs by calling s:UpdateScope() on the TabEnter event. 
"     
" 1-Jun-2009, Ingo Karkat
"  1. Now using Vim List for g:mwWord and thus requiring Vim 7. g:mwCycle is now
"     zero-based, but the syntax groups "MarkWordx" are still one-based. 
"  2. Added missing setter for re-inclusion guard. 
"  3. Factored :syntax operations out of s:DoMark() and s:UpdateMark() so that
"     they can all be done in a single :windo. 
"  4. Normal mode <Plug>MarkSet now has the same semantics as its visual mode
"     cousin: If the cursor is on an existing mark, the mark is removed.
"     Beforehand, one could only remove a visually selected mark via again
"     selecting it. Now, one simply can invoke the mapping when on such a mark. 
"  5. Highlighting can now actually be overridden in the vimrc (anywhere
"     _before_ sourcing this script) by using ':hi def'. 
"
" 31-May-2009, Ingo Karkat
"  1. Refactored s:Search() to optionally take advantage of SearchSpecial.vim
"     autoload functionality for echoing of search pattern, wrap and error
"     messages. 
"  2. Now prepending search type ("any-mark", "same-mark", "new-mark") for
"     better identification. 
"  3. Retired the algorithm in s:PrevWord in favor of simply using <cword>,
"     which makes mark.vim work like the * command. At the end of a line,
"     non-keyword characters may now be marked; the previous algorithm prefered
"     any preceding word. 
"  4. BF: If 'iskeyword' contains characters that have a special meaning in a
"     regex (e.g. [.*]), these are now escaped properly. 
"
" 01-Sep-2008, Ingo Karkat: bugfixes and enhancements
"  1. Added <Plug>MarkAllClear (without a default mapping), which clears all
"     marks, even when the cursor is on a mark.
"  2. Added <Plug>... mappings for hard-coded \*, \#, \/, \?, * and #, to allow
"     re-mapping and disabling. Beforehand, there were some <Plug>... mappings
"     and hard-coded ones; now, everything can be customized.
"  3. Bugfix: Using :autocmd without <bang> to avoid removing _all_ autocmds for
"     the BufWinEnter event. (Using a custom :augroup would be even better.)
"  4. Bugfix: Explicitly defining s:current_mark_position; some execution paths
"     left it undefined, causing errors.
"  5. Refactoring: Instead of calling s:InitMarkVariables() at the beginning of
"     several functions, just calling it once when sourcing the script.
"  6. Refactoring: Moved multiple 'let lastwinnr = winnr()' to a single one at the
"     top of DoMark().
"  7. ENH: Make the match according to the 'ignorecase' setting, like the star
"     command.
"  8. The jumps to the next/prev occurrence now print 'search hit BOTTOM,
"     continuing at TOP" and "Pattern not found:..." messages, like the * and
"     n/N Vim search commands.
"  9. Jumps now open folds if the occurrence is inside a closed fold, just like n/N
"     do. 
"
" 10th Mar 2006, Yuheng Xie: jump to ANY mark
" (*) added \* \# \/ \? for the ability of jumping to ANY mark, even when the
"     cursor is not currently over any mark
"
" 20th Sep 2005, Yuheng Xie: minor modifications
" (*) merged MarkRegexVisual into MarkRegex
" (*) added GetVisualSelectionEscaped for multi-lines visual selection and
"     visual selection contains ^, $, etc.
" (*) changed the name ThisMark to CurrentMark
" (*) added SearchCurrentMark and re-used raw map (instead of Vim function) to
"     implement * and #
"
" 14th Sep 2005, Luc Hermitte: modifications done on v1.1.4
" (*) anti-reinclusion guards. They do not guard colors definitions in case
"     this script must be reloaded after .gvimrc
" (*) Protection against disabled |line-continuation|s.
" (*) Script-local functions
" (*) Default keybindings
" (*) \r for visual mode
" (*) uses <Leader> instead of "\"
" (*) do not mess with global variable g:w
" (*) regex simplified -> double quotes changed into simple quotes.
" (*) strpart(str, idx, 1) -> str[idx]
" (*) command :Mark
"     -> e.g. :Mark Mark.\{-}\ze(

"- default highlightings ------------------------------------------------------
" You may define your own colors in your vimrc file, in the form as below:
highlight def MarkWord1  ctermbg=Cyan     ctermfg=Black  guibg=#8CCBEA    guifg=Black
highlight def MarkWord2  ctermbg=Green    ctermfg=Black  guibg=#A4E57E    guifg=Black
highlight def MarkWord3  ctermbg=Yellow   ctermfg=Black  guibg=#FFDB72    guifg=Black
highlight def MarkWord4  ctermbg=Red      ctermfg=Black  guibg=#FF7272    guifg=Black
highlight def MarkWord5  ctermbg=Magenta  ctermfg=Black  guibg=#FFB3FF    guifg=Black
highlight def MarkWord6  ctermbg=Blue     ctermfg=Black  guibg=#9999FF    guifg=Black

" Default highlighting for the special search type. 
" You can override this by defining / linking the 'SearchSpecialSearchType'
" highlight group before this script is sourced.
