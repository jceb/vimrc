NARROW REGION							*narrow-region*

This is the narrow-regionÂ© plugin. It really just glues some (mostly fold- )
options together and throws in some mappings.

==============================================================================

:[range]NarrowRegion
		This command does the following, with [range] defaulting to
		the current line :
		- store current folds, foldstates and foldoptions
		- delete all folds
		- setl foldopen=undo
		- setl foldclose=all
		- setl foldminlines=0
		- setl foldmethod=manual
		- fold all lines outside of range
		- setup the nice extras, see below

		It's safe to execute this command more than once, without
		using the next command first. It won't restore it's own
		settings.
		This always works on a 'per-buffer' basis.

:UnNarrowRegion
		Undo everything done above.

==============================================================================

OPTIONS							*narrow-region-options*

The global 'g:narrow_region_options' tells the plugin, what mappings,
etc. it should activate. Every char in this variable stands for one option.
This currently includes the following  : >

	':'	-	If this is included, pressing ':' as the first key on
			the commandline, will insert the range of the region.
	'c'	-	This will make ':g', ':s' and ':v' always have the
			range prepended.
	'h'	-	This one will hide the folded lines. In other words,
			it will link the hlgroup 'Folded' to 'Ignore'.

The default is ':', which is the least intrusive.The mappings and
abbreviations are <buffer> local. See also |:folddoopen| and |:folddoclosed|.

==============================================================================

LIMITATIONS AND ISSUES					*narrow-region-issues*

You can not easily widen a region, because vim automagically extends a range,
which ends in a closed fold to the end of the fold. You have 2 choices, either
'unnarrow` the region first or open the folds before you execute such a
command. On the other side, this can be and advantage : For example execute
'NarrowRegion', without a range, on a closed fold and everything else will be
hidden.
Searching is limited to the region, but you will notice, that vim moves the
cursor onto the closed folds, if they contain a match. Not really a
disadvantage!
