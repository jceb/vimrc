This directory contains the main scripts that come bundled with UltiSnips.

Standing On The Shoulders of Giants
===================================

The snippets have been collected from various other project which I want to
express my gratitude for. Not all files have been reviewed for 100%
compatibility with UltiSnips, but bugs will be fixed over time. 

The prefixes for the file show their origin:

   tm - TextMate: http://svn.textmate.org/trunk/Bundles/
   sm - SnipMate: http://code.google.com/p/snipmate/

All files without a prefix are either original or cleaned up versions; that is
the snippets inside them are 
  - not using shell script, only python (so they are cross platform compatible)
  - not using any feature that UltiSnips doesn't offer; so no text artifacts should appear    while using those
