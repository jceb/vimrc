version 1.2:
  - many bugs were fixed
  - smode mappings for printable characters are now removed before expanding a
    snippet. This is configurable. *UltiSnips-warning-smappings*
  - all shipped snippets are now fully compatible with UltiSnips
  - added support for global snippets which enhance python interpolation even
    more *UltiSnips-globals*
  - added support for multi word and regular expression triggers. Very
    powerful in combination with python interpolation.
  - Python interpolation became much more powerful *UltiSnips-python* 
  - added support for clearsnippets command *UltiSnips-clearing-snippets*
  - added support for option w which is a little more strict than i.
  - added support for listing of valid triggers. Defaults to <c-tab>.
  - added support for option i (inword expansion)
  - extends keyword is now supported on the first line of snippet files. This makes it easy to
	 define special cases, for example cpp extends c: a cpp trigger is useless
	 in c, but a c trigger is valuable for cpp. 
  - UltiSnips now adheres to expandtab and tabstop options of vim

version 1.1:
  - Made triggers configurable. You can also use the same trigger for
	 expanding and tabbing. The TextMate configuration <tab> and <s-tab> is now
	 possible.
  - Conditional Inserts can now be nested
  - Added support for b option. This only considers a snippet at the beginning
	 of a line ( *UltiSnips-adding-snippets* )
  - Added support for ! option. This overwrites previously defined snippets
    with the same tab trigger ( *UltiSnips-adding-snippets* )
  - Support for dotted filetype syntax. Now snippets for more than one filetype
    can be active ( *UltiSnips-adding-snippets* )
