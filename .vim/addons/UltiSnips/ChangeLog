version 1.1:
  - Made triggers configurable. You can also use the same trigger for
	 expanding and tabbing. The TextMate configuration <tab> and <s-tab> is now
	 possible.
  - Conditional Inserts can now be nested
  - Added support for b option. This only considers a snippet at the beginning
	 of a line ( *UltiSnips-adding-snippets* )
  - Added support for ! option. This overwrites previously defined snippets
    with the same tab trigger ( *UltiSnips-adding-snippets* )
  - Support for dotted filetype syntax. Now snippets for more than one filetype
    can be active ( *UltiSnips-adding-snippets* )
