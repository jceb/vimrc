" Summary:  Vim plugin for transparent editing of gpg encrypted files.
" Licence:  This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
"           modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License.

" Section: Documentation {{{1
" Description:
"
"   This script implements transparent editing of gpg encrypted files. The
"   filename must have a ".gpg", ".pgp" or ".asc" suffix. When opening such
"   a file the content is decrypted, when opening a new file the script will
"   ask for the recipients of the encrypted file. The file content will be
"   encrypted to all recipients before it is written. The script turns off
"   viminfo and swapfile to increase security.
"
" Installation:
"
"   Copy the gnupg.vim file to the $HOME/.vim/plugin directory.
"   Refer to ':help add-plugin', ':help add-global-plugin' and ':help
"   runtimepath' for more details about Vim plugins.
"
"   From "man 1 gpg-agent":
"
"   ...
"   You should always add the following lines to your .bashrc or whatever
"   initialization file is used for all shell invocations:
"
"        GPG_TTY=`tty`
"        export GPG_TTY
"
"   It is important that this environment variable always reflects the out‚Äê
"   put of the tty command. For W32 systems this option is not required.
"   ...
"
" Commands:
"
"   :GPGEditRecipients
"     Opens a scratch buffer to change the list of recipients. Recipients that
"     are unknown (not in your public key) are highlighted and have
"     a prepended "!". Closing the buffer makes the changes permanent.
"
"   :GPGViewRecipients
"     Prints the list of recipients.
"
"   :GPGEditOptions
"     Opens a scratch buffer to change the options for encryption (symmetric,
"     asymmetric, signing). Closing the buffer makes the changes permanent.
"     WARNING: There is no check of the entered options, so you need to know
"     what you are doing.
"
"   :GPGViewOptions
"     Prints the list of options.
"
" Variables:
"
"   g:GPGExecutable
"     If set used as gpg executable, otherwise the system chooses what is run
"     when "gpg" is called. Defaults to "gpg".
"
"   g:GPGUseAgent
"     If set to 0 a possible available gpg-agent won't be used. Defaults to 1.
"
"   g:GPGPreferSymmetric
"     If set to 1 symmetric encryption is preferred for new files. Defaults to 0.
"
"   g:GPGPreferArmor
"     If set to 1 armored data is preferred for new files. Defaults to 0.
"
"   g:GPGPreferSign
"     If set to 1 signed data is preferred for new files. Defaults to 0.
"
"   g:GPGDefaultRecipients
"     If set, these recipients are used as defaults when no other recipient is
"     defined. This variable is a Vim list. Default is unset.
"
" Known Issues:
"
"   In some cases gvim can't decryt files

"   This is caused by the fact that a running gvim has no TTY and thus gpg is
"   not able to ask for the passphrase by itself. This is a problem for Windows
"   and Linux versions of gvim and could not be solved unless a "terminal
"   emulation" is implemented for gvim. To circumvent this you have to use any
"   combination of gpg-agent and a graphical pinentry program:
"
"     - gpg-agent only:
"         you need to provide the passphrase for the needed key to gpg-agent
"         in a terminal before you open files with gvim which require this key.
"
"     - pinentry only:
"         you will get a popup window every time you open a file that needs to
"         be decrypted.
"
"     - gpgagent and pinentry:
"         you will get a popup window the first time you open a file that
"         needs to be decrypted.
