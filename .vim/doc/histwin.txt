2. Functionality

This plugin was written to allow an easy way of browsing the |undo-tree|, that
is available with Vim. This allows to go back to any change that has been made
previously, because these states are remembered by Vim within a branch in the
undo-history. You can use |g-| or |g+| to move in Vim within the different
undo-branches.

Unfortunately, going back to any state isn't very comfortable and you always
need to remember at what time you did that change. Therefore the histwin-Plugin
allows to easily view the available states and branch back to any of these
states. It opens a new window, which contains all available states and using
this plugin allows you to tag a previous change or go back to a particular
state.

                                                         *histwin-browse* *:UB*
2.1 Opening the Undo-Tree Window

By default you can open the Undo-Tree Window by issuing :UB (Mnemonic:
UndoBrowse). If you do this the first time, you will see a window that looks
like this:

+------------------------------------------------------+
|Undo-Tree: FILENAME           |#!/bin/bash            |
|======================        |                       |
|                              |                       |
|" actv. keys in this window   |if [ $# -ne 2 ];  the  |
|" I toggles help screen       |    echo "Name: $0: arg|
|" <Enter> goto undo branch    |    echo               |
|" <C-L>   Update view         |    exit 1             |
|" T	   Tag sel. branch     |fi                     |    
|" P	   Toggle view         |                       |    
|" D	   Diff sel. branch    |if true; then          |    
|" R	   Replay sel. branch  |    dir="${1%/*}"      |    
|" C	   Clear all tags      |    file="${1##*/}"    |    
|" Q	   Quit window         |    target="${2}/${di  |    
|"                             |    if [ ! -e "${targ  |
|" Undo-Tree, v0.9             |        mkdir -p "$ta  |
|                              |        mv "$1" "$tar  |
|Nr   Time    Tag              |                       |
|1) 00:00:00 /Start Editing/   |                       |
|2) 22:50:43 /First draft/     |                       |
|3) 23:01:22                   |                       |
|4) 23:02:57                   |                       |
|5) 23:05:04                   |                       |
+------------------------------------------------------+

This shows an extract of a sample file on the right side. The window on the
left side, contains an overview of all available states that are known for
this buffer or that have been tagged to remember that change.

The first line contains 'Undo-Tree: filename' so that the user knows, for
which file this window shows the available undo-branches. This is the heading.

Following the heading is a small information banner, that contains the most
important key combinations, that are available in this window. 

After that list, all available undo-changes are displayed. This is a list,
that contains the number, the time this change was made, the change-number to
use with the |:undo| command (this is by default not shown), and the tags,
that have been entered. A bar shows the selected undo-branch that is active on
the right side.

Please note, that the Time for start-editing will always be shown as 00:00:00,
because currently there is no way to retrieve this time from within vim.

3. Keybindings

By default, the following keys are active in Normal mode in the Undo-Tree
window:

'Enter'  Go to the branch, on which is selected with the cursor
'<C-L>'  Update the window
'T'      Tag the branch, that is selected. You'll be prompted for a tag.
'P'      Toggle view (the change-number will be displayed). You can use this
         number to go directly to that change (see |:undo|)
'D'      Start diff mode with the branch that is selected by the cursor.
         (see |08.7|)
'R'      Replay all changes, that have been made from the beginning.
         (see |histwin-config| for adjusting the speed)
'C'      Clear all tags.
'Q'      Quit window

4.1 Configuration variables

You can adjust several parameters for the Undo-Tree window, by setting some
variables in your .vimrc file.

To always show only a small information banner, set this in your .vimrc
(by default this variable is 1)

:let g:undo_tree_help = 0

To have the Change number always included, set the g:undo_tree_dtl=0:
(by default, this variable is 1)

:let g:undo_tree_dtl = 0

The speed with which to show each change, when replaying a undo-branch can be
adjusted by setting to a value in milliseconds. If not specified, this is
100ms.

:let g:undo_tree_speed=200

You can adjust the windows size by setting g:undo_tree_wdth to the number of
columns you like. By default this is considered 30. When the change number is
included in the list (see above), this value will increase by 10.

:let g:undo_tree_wdth=40

This will change the width of the window to 40 or 50, if the change number
is included.

                                                                *histwin-color*
4.2 Color configuration

If you want to customize the colors, you can simply change the following
groups, that are defined by the Undo-Tree Browser:

UBTitle   this defines the color of the title file-name. By default this links
          to Title (see |hl-Title|)
UBInfo    this defines how the information banner looks like. By default this
          links to Comment.
UBList    this group defines the List items at the start e.g. 1), 2), This
          links  to Identifier.
UBTime    this defines, how the time is displayed. This links to Underlined.
UBTag     This defines, how the tag should be highlighted. By default this
          links to Special
UBDelim   This group defines the look of the delimiter for the tag. By default
          this links to Ignore
UBActive  This group defines how the active selection is displayed. By default
          this links to PmenuSel (see |hl-PmenuSel|)

Say you want to change the color for the Tag values and you think, it should
look like |IncSerch|, so you can do this in your .vimrc file:

:hi link UBTag IncSearch
