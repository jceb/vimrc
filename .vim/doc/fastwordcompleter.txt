							*fastwordcompleter*

Fastwordcompleter is a plugin to support editing of arbitrary text files
through offering autocompletion while typing. The plugin is highly inspired by
http://vim.sourceforge.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=73 but in contrast
much much faster.

VARIABLES

Autoactivate fast word completion for the defined filetypes - comma separated.

let g:fastwordcompleter_filetypes = 'filetype,...'

Normally the vim complete option is set to show no menu if only one item is
avaiable for completion. Fastwordcompleter sets completeopt to menuone to
display also single items. If you don't like this set the following variable.

let g:loaded_fastwordcompletion = 1

COMMANDS

Start and stop fast word completion or use the menu Plugin/FastWordCompleter:

:FastWordCompletionStart
:FastWordCompletionStop
