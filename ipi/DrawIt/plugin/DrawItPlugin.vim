" DrawItPlugin.vim: a simple way to draw things in Vim -- just put this file in
"             your plugin directory, use \di to start (\ds to stop), and
"             just move about using the cursor keys.
"
"             You may also use visual-block mode to select endpoints and
"             draw lines, arrows, and ellipses.
