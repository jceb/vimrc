" REVISION	DATE		REMARKS
"   1.70.013	17-Aug-2012	ENH: Check for searches wrapping around the
"				buffer and issue a corresponding warning, like
"				the built-in searches do. Though the mappings
"				that can be made with CountJump currently do not
"				use 'wrapscan', other plugins that define their
"				own jump functions and use the
"				CountJump#CountJump() function for it may use
"				it. Create function overloads
"				CountJump#CountJumpWithWrapMessage() and
"				CountJump#CountSearchWithWrapMessage().
"   1.41.012	13-Jun-2011	FIX: Directly ring the bell to avoid problems
"				when running under :silent!.
"   1.30.011	19-Dec-2010	Removed return value of jump position from
"				CountJump#CountJump() and CountJump#JumpFunc();
"				it isn't needed, as these functions are
"				typically used directly in motion mappings.
"				CountJump#JumpFunc() now uses cursor position
"				after invoking jump function, and doesn't
"				require a returned position any more. This is
"				only a special case for CountJump#TextObject,
"				and should not be generally required of a jump
"				function. The jump function is now also expected
"				to beep, so removed that here.
"   1.30.010	18-Dec-2010	Moved CountJump#Region#Jump() here as
"				CountJump#JumpFunc(). It fits here much better
"				because of the similarity to
"				CountJump#CountJump(), and actually has nothing
"				to do with regions.
"   1.20.009	30-Jul-2010	FIX: CountJump#CountJump() with mode "O" didn't
"				add original position to jump list. Simplified
"				conditional.
"   1.10.008	15-Jul-2010	Changed behavior if there aren't [count]
"				matches: Instead of jumping to the last
"				available match (and ringing the bell), the
"				cursor stays at the original position, like with
"				the old vi-compatible motions.
"				ENH: Only adding to jump list if there actually
"				is a match. This is like the built-in Vim
"				motions work.
"   1.00.007	22-Jun-2010	Added special mode 'O' for
"				CountJump#CountJump() with special correction
"				for a pattern to end in operator-pending mode.
"				Reviewed for use in operator-pending mode.
"	006	03-Oct-2009	Now returning [lnum, col] like searchpos(), not
"				just line number.
"	005	02-Oct-2009	CountJump#CountSearch() now handles 'c' search()
"				flag; it is cleared on subsequent iterations to
"				avoid staying put at the current match.
"	004	14-Feb-2009	Renamed from 'custommotion.vim' to
"				'CountJump.vim' and split off motion and
"				text object parts.
"	003	13-Feb-2009	Added functionality to create inner/outer text
"				objects delimited by the same begin and end
"				patterns.
"	002	13-Feb-2009	Now also allowing end match for the
"				patternToEnd.
"	001	12-Feb-2009	file creation
