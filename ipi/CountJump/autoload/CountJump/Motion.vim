" REVISION	DATE		REMARKS 
"   1.60.007	27-Mar-2012	ENH: When keys start with <Plug>, insert Forward
"				/ Backward instead of prepending [ / ].
"   1.30.006	19-Dec-2010	Clarified interface of jump function arguments;
"				no need to return jump position here. 
"   1.22.005	06-Aug-2010	No more motion mappings for select mode; as the
"				mappings start with a printable character, no
"				select-mode mapping should be defined. 
"   1.20.004	30-Jul-2010	ENH: a:keyAfterBracket and
"				a:inverseKeyAfterBracket can now be empty, the
"				resulting mappings are then omitted. 
"				Likewise, any jump function can be empty in
"				CountJump#Motion#MakeBracketMotionWithJumpFunctions(). 
"   1.20.003	21-Jul-2010	With the added
"				CountJump#Motion#MakeBracketMotionWithJumpFunctions()
"				motions can be defined via jump functions,
"				similar to how text objects can be defined. This
"				is a generalization of
"				CountJump#Motion#MakeBracketMotion(), but the
"				latter isn't now implemented through the
"				generalization to avoid overhead and because the
"				similarities are not as strong as with the text
"				objects. 
"   1.00.002	22-Jun-2010	Added missing :omaps for operator-pending mode. 
"				Replaced s:Escape() with string() and simplified
"				building of l:dataset. 
"				Added special mode 'O' to indicate
"				operator-pending mapping with
"				a:isEndPatternToEnd. 
"				Allowing to specify map modes via optional
"				argument to CountJump#Motion#MakeBracketMotion()
"				to allow to skip or use different patterns for
"				some modes. 
"	001	14-Feb-2009	Renamed from 'custommotion.vim' to
"				'CountJump.vim' and split off motion and
"				text object parts. 
"				file creation

"*******************************************************************************
"* PURPOSE:
"   Define a complete set of mappings for a [x / ]x motion (e.g. like the
"   built-in ]m "Jump to start of next method") that support an optional [count]
"   and are driven by search patterns for the beginning and end of a block. 
"   The mappings work in normal mode (jump), visual mode (expand selection) and
"   operator-pending mode (execute operator). 
"
"* ASSUMPTIONS / PRECONDITIONS:
"   None. 
"
"* EFFECTS / POSTCONDITIONS:
"   Creates mappings for normal, visual and operator-pending mode: 
"	Normal mode: Jumps to the <count>th occurrence. 
"	Visual mode: Extends the selection to the <count>th occurrence. 
"	Operator-pending mode: Applies the operator to the covered text. 
"	If the pattern doesn't match (<count> times), a beep is emitted. 
"
"* INPUTS:
"   a:mapArgs	Arguments to the :map command, like '<buffer>' for a
"		buffer-local mapping. 
"   a:keyAfterBracket	Mapping key [sequence] after the mandatory ] / [ which
"			start the mapping for a motion to the beginning of a
"			block. 
"			When this starts with <Plug>, the key sequence is taken
"			as a template and a %s is replaced with "Forward" /
"			"Backward" instead of prepending ] / [. Through this,
"			plugins can define configurable mappings that not
"			necessarily start with ] / [.
"			Can be empty; the resulting mappings are then omitted. 
"   a:inverseKeyAfterBracket	Likewise, but for the motions to the end of a
"				block. Usually the uppercased version of
"				a:keyAfterBracket. 
"				Can be empty; the resulting mappings are then
"				omitted. 
"   If both a:keyAfterBracket and a:inverseKeyAfterBracket are empty, the
"   default [[ and ]] mappings are overwritten. (Note that this is different
"   from passing ']' and '[', respectively, because the back motions are
"   swapped.) 
"   a:patternToBegin	Search pattern to locate the beginning of a block. 
"   a:patternToEnd	Search pattern to locate the end of a block. 
"   a:isEndPatternToEnd	Flag that specifies whether a jump to the end of a block
"			will be to the end of the match. This makes it easier to
"			write an end pattern for characterwise motions (like
"			e.g. a block delimited by {{{ and }}}). 
"			Linewise motions best not set this flag, so that the
"			end match positions the cursor in the first column. 
"   a:mapModes		Optional string containing 'n', 'o' and/or 'v',
"			representing the modes for which mappings should be
"			created. Defaults to all modes. 
"
"* NOTES:
"   - If your motion is linewise, the patterns should have the start of match
"     at the first column. This results in the expected behavior in normal mode,
"     and in characterwise visual mode selects up to that line, and in (more
"     likely) linewise visual mode includes the complete end line. 
"   - Depending on the 'selection' setting, the first matched character is
"     either included or excluded in a characterwise visual selection.
