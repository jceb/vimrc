" REVISION	DATE		REMARKS 
"   1.60.012	27-Mar-2012	ENH: When keys start with <Plug>, insert Inner /
"				Outer instead of prepending i / a.
"   1.50.011	30-Aug-2011	Initialize global g:CountJump_Context object for
"				custom use by Funcrefs. 
"   1.40.010	20-Dec-2010	Replaced s:Escape() function with string(). 
"   1.22.009	06-Aug-2010	No more text objects for select mode; as the
"				mappings start with a printable character ("a" /
"				"i"), no select-mode mapping should be defined. 
"   1.21.008	03-Aug-2010	FIX: Must not do (characterwise) end position
"				adaptation for linewise text object that does
"				not exclude boundaries. 
"   1.20.007	02-Aug-2010	The adjustment movements after the jumps to the
"				text object boundaries now do not cause beeps if
"				that movement cannot be done (e.g. a 'j' at the
"				end of the buffer). 
"   1.20.006	21-Jul-2010	Only creating the visual selection for the text
"				object after both begin and end position have
"				been determined to be existing. This avoids
"				having to abort the visual selection when
"				there's no end position and allows to use 'gv'
"				to re-enter the previous visual mode with
"				previously selected text. 
"   1.10.005	19-Jul-2010	FIX: For a linewise text object, the end cursor
"				column is not important; do not compare with the
"				original cursor column in this case. 
"   1.00.004	03-Oct-2009	BUG: The functions generated by
"				CountJump#TextObject#MakeWithCountSearch() must
"				include the type when not both inner and outer
"				text objects are defined. 
"				BUG: For the outer jump to end, a:patternToEnd
"				must not match at the current cursor position
"				(no 'c' flag to search()). This allows to handle
"				outer text objects that are delimited by the
"				same, single character. 
"				Escaping a:textObjectKey when used in a function
"				name via s:EscapeForFunctionName(). This allows
"				to use non-alphabetical keys for a text object
"				(e.g. i$, a$). 
"	003	03-Oct-2009	ENH: Inner text objects can now be selected when
"				the cursor is on the boundary text, like the
"				built-in text object. The jump Funcrefs now
"				return the jump position (like searchpos()), not
"				just the jump line number. 
"	002	02-Oct-2009	ENH: Checking whether the jump is not around the
"				cursor position. 
"				ENH: Consistently beeping and re-entering visual
"				mode in case of no selection of text object,
"				like the built-in text objects behave. Added
"				a:mode argument to
"				CountJump#TextObject#TextObjectWithJumpFunctions(). 
"	001	14-Feb-2009	Renamed from 'custommotion.vim' to
"				'CountJump.vim' and split off motion and
"				text object parts.

function! CountJump#TextObject#TextObjectWithJumpFunctions( mode, isInner, isExcludeBoundaries, selectionMode, JumpToBegin, JumpToEnd )
"*******************************************************************************
"* PURPOSE:
"   Creates a visual selection (in a:selectionMode) around the <count>'th
"   inner / outer text object delimited by the a:JumpToBegin and a:JumpToEnd
"   functions. 
"   If there is no match, or the jump is not around the cursor position, the
"   failure to select the text object is indicated via a beep. In visual mode,
"   the selection is maintained then (using a:selectionMode). the built-in text
"   objects work in the same way. 
"
"* ASSUMPTIONS / PRECONDITIONS:
"   None. 
"
"* EFFECTS / POSTCONDITIONS:
"   Creates / modifies visual selection. 
"
"* INPUTS:
"   a:mode  Mode for the text object; either 'o' (operator-pending) or 'v'
"	    (visual). 
"   a:isInner	Flag whether this is an "inner" text object (i.e. it excludes
"		the boundaries, or an "outer" one. This variable is passed to
"		the a:JumpToBegin and a:JumpToEnd functions. 
"   a:isExcludeBoundaries   Flag whether the matching boundaries should not be
"			    part of the text object. Except for special cases,
"			    the value should correspond with a:isInner. 
"   a:selectionMode Specifies how the text object selects text; either 'v', 'V'
"		    or "\<C-V>". 
"   a:JumpToBegin   Funcref that jumps to the beginning of the text object. 
"		    The function must take a count (always 1 here) and the
"		    a:isInner flag (which determines whether the jump should be
"		    to the end of the boundary text). 
"		    The function is invoked at the cursor position where the
"		    text object was requested. 
"   a:JumpToEnd	    Funcref that jumps to the end of the text object. 
"		    The function must take a count and the a:isInner flag. 
"		    The function is invoked after the call to a:JumpToBegin,
"		    with the cursor located at the beginning of the text object. 
"
"		    Both Funcrefs must return a list [lnum, col], like
"		    searchpos(). This should be the jump position (or [0, 0] if
"		    a jump wasn't possible). Normally, this should correspond to
"		    the cursor position set by the jump function. However, for
"		    an inner jump, this could also be the outer jump position.
"		    This function will use this position for the check that the
"		    jump is around the cursor position; if the returned position
"		    is the outer jump position, an inner text object will allow
"		    selection even when the cursor is on the boundary text (like
"		    the built-in text objects). 
"* RETURN VALUES: 
"   None. 
"
"* KNOWN PROBLEMS:
"   At the beginning and end of the buffer, the inner text objects may select
"   one character / line less than it should, because the compensating motions
"   are always executed, but the jump cannot position the cursor "outside" the
"   buffer (i.e. before the first / after the last line).
