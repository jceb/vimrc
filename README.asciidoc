Jan Christoph's personal vim configuration
==========================================

USAGE
-----

The first thing you should do is install quilt and apply all the
patches. This is useful because a lot of the installed plugins didn't
fit my needs or have little bugs that disrupt my work.
Once you are done with this you might want to add a .vim/personal.vim
file which contains additional settings. Have a look at the help topic
config-personal.vim (*:h config-personal.vim*) for more information.

Every plugin that's used for this configuration has been registered in
the file .vim/GetLatest/GetLatestVimScripts.dat additionally all changes
I did to the plugins are tracked by quilt in the patches directory.

To get an idea of what plugins are available and how to use them run the
following command in vim:
:h config

That's basically it.

If you have questions, comments, patches ... please send it to
github@DELETE-ME-e-jc.de

INSTALL
-------

Run *register_dotvim* to register the .vim, .vimrc and other .vim* files
properly.
